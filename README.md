## Features

- **Azure AD Authentication**: Secure your files with robust authentication.
- **Per-User Access Control**: Each user can have their own bucket for file storage.
- **Lightweight and Minimal**: Quick to set up and easy to use.

## Getting Started

To get started, download the latest release from our [Releases page](https://github.com/deepiitain/flask-fileserver/releases). Follow the instructions to set up the server on your local machine or server.

## Usage

Once set up, you can use the file server to upload, download, and manage files in a user-friendly way. Each user will have access to their own storage bucket, ensuring that files are organized and secure.

## API Endpoints

### File Upload

- **Endpoint**: `/upload`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Description**: Upload a file to your bucket.

### File Download

- **Endpoint**: `/download/<file_id>`
- **Method**: `GET`
- **Description**: Download a file from your bucket.

### List Files

- **Endpoint**: `/files`

## Authentication

This server uses Azure AD for authentication. Users must log in using their Azure credentials to access their files. The server will handle the authentication process and provide tokens for secure access.

## Bucket Management

Each user has their own bucket for file storage. Buckets are isolated, ensuring that users cannot access each other's files. You can manage buckets through the API, creating and deleting them as needed.
